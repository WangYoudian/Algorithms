# Algorithms
When encountering an algorithmic problem, the best way is to be comfronted with it rather than get rid of it. So the problem can now be turned into an optimization problem of how to better solve it. The best answer is always the ultimate pursuit, which not depends on how clever you are but the way you try. It's about time-costing, but it's never time-wasting.
